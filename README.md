💧 Water Quality Prediction – RMS
This project aims to predict multiple water quality parameters using machine learning techniques—specifically a MultiOutputRegressor wrapped around a RandomForestRegressor. It was developed as part of a one-month AICTE Virtual Internship sponsored by Shell in June 2025.

🌍 Overview
Access to clean and safe water is a global priority. Predicting water quality parameters accurately can assist in early detection of contamination and facilitate proactive intervention.

In this project, we:

Collected and preprocessed real-world water quality datasets

Applied supervised learning for multi-output regression

Built a pipeline using MultiOutputRegressor with RandomForestRegressor

Evaluated the model using various regression metrics

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.12

Pandas, NumPy – Data preprocessing & manipulation

Scikit-learn – Machine learning modeling & evaluation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive development

🔮 Predicted Water Quality Parameters
The model is capable of predicting several important water quality indicators, including:

NH₄ (Ammonium)

BOD₅ (Biochemical Oxygen Demand)

Colloids

O₂ (Dissolved Oxygen)

NO₃ (Nitrate), NO₂ (Nitrite)

SO₄ (Sulfate), PO₄ (Phosphate)

Cl⁻ (Chloride)
