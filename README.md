# 💧 Water Pollutants Prediction

A Streamlit web application that predicts water pollutant levels based on the **year** and **station ID** using a machine learning model trained on historical water quality data (2000–2021).

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is built to help analyze water pollution trends by estimating six key pollutants:

- **O₂** (Oxygen)
- **NO₃** (Nitrate)
- **NO₂** (Nitrite)
- **SO₄** (Sulfate)
- **PO₄** (Phosphate)
- **CL** (Chloride)

It uses a trained machine learning model and provides an easy-to-use interface for making predictions.
